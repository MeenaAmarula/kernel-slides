# Kernel development slides

## Purpose

The purpose of these slides is to provide some notes to newcomers to kernel
development. As approaching the Linux kernel development is difficult, we aim to
simplify the procedure.

## Technology

We use [slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev) for writing our slides. This
allows us to have a common template, to be able to export slides in a very fast
way and to review them as text, allowing us to use git to correct us without
doing it "the old way" (not as old as saving them on ~~floppy disks~~ USB
devices and passing them around).
